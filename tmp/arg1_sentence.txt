what happen Friday show that financial market be not yet sufficiently coordinate to handle another meltdown in price
after the 1987 plunge , market agree that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic condition arise
the New York Stock Exchange adopt two specific circuit breaker
if the Dow Jones index fall 250 point in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour
the New York Stock Exchange adopt two specific circuit breaker : if the Dow Jones index fall 250 point in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hit 400 point , the exchange will close for a additional two hour
it be impossible to know whether that theory be realistic
what happen Friday be the worst of all world

future trading , however , be halt altogether at 3:45 , after the future market have drop a additional 30 point , which be the daily limit for price decline
it be time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the future market and the option market , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwine as to constitute one market effectively
it therefore make no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breaker
synchronize circuit breaker would not have halt the slide in price on Friday , but they probably would have make for smoother , less volatile execution
it be time for the exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint condition for halt trading or stay open
the need for hurry last-minute telephone negotiation among market official will disappear once rule be in place that synchronize circuit breaker in all market
the new circuit breaker , if they be to be apply at all , will require that future and option trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remain open
the rule should be establish by agreement of the official of all affect exchange act under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agency
